=== 2.2.0 / 2011-07-18

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Added +hg_subrepos+ variable. When set to +true+, the export step recurses
    into subdirectories (adds the -S flag to <code>hg archive</code>).

* 1 bug fix

  * Now does a proper <code>hg clone</code>, so that the default path on the
    deployment clone is set to the central repository. This is necessary if your
    repo has subrepos with relative paths.

=== 2.1.3 / 2010-11-22

* 2 bugfixes

  * Honor the setting of +deploy_via+. Thanks to McClain Looney.

  * Use 'default' as the actual default value of +revision+. This will break
    your configuration if you were manually doing something silly like <tt>set
    :revision, 'head'</tt> in your deploy.rb. But you wouldn't do that, would
    you?

=== 2.1.2 / 2010-09-15

* 1 bug fix

  * If +revision+ isn't specified, use 'default' instead of 'tip'. This fixes
    what would be unexpected behavior from a repository whose tip isn't on the
    default branch.

=== 2.1.1 / 2010-06-15

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Patch queues: pop patches *before* pulling, to avoid superfluous (+1 heads)
    messages.

=== 2.1.0 / 2010-06-04

* 1 major enhancement

  * Add support for deploying with a patch queue. Useful e.g. for setting up a
    staging site with minor changes to the production configuration.

=== 2.0.2 / 2009-08-28

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Fix a bug causing non-tip revisions to pull the wrong changeset hash.

=== 2.0.1 / 2009-08-19

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Release via hitsquad project

=== 2.0.0 / 2009-08-19

* 1 major enhancement

  * Birthday!
